# SnapLensStudio-OBJBuilder
Convert .obj files to JavaScript files, to be interpreted by Lens Studio's MeshBuilder.


Run Python/objToJS.py using the terminal to automatically convert all .obj files in its directory to JavaScript files.
Import those into Lens Studio and add them to the scene, so they can be used with the OBJBuilderController.

Make sure .obj files to be converted are triangulated and have per-point UVs and normals.
