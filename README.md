# SnapLensStudio-OBJBuilder
Convert .obj files to JavaScript files to be interpreted by Lens Studio's MeshBuilder.


Run Python/objToJS.py using the terminal to convert all .obj files to JavaScript files.
Import those into Lens Studio and add them to the scene, so they can be used with the OBJBuilderController.
